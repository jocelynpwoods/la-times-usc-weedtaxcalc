		<h1>Are you spending double what your neighbors are on pot tax?</h1>

		<p>Thirteen miles south of downtown Los Angeles, in the city of Carson, more than half of voters approved an 18 percent tax on all cannabis-related businesses. In the neighboring town of Culver City, that same tax is set at 0 -- for now. </p>


		<p>This means if a customer were to purchase $100 worth of recreational weed in Carson, they would pay almost double the tax than if they were to buy it just 19 miles away.</p>

		<p>Are you getting the best price for your pot? Enter what you'd like to spend and watch your total rise.</p>

		<h5>*Note: This applies only to recreational cannabis, tax rates are subject to change.</h5>
